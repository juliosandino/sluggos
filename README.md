# Sluggos: Sharing the Santa Cruz Experience
Bryan Garcia, and I (Julio Sandino) want to share our UCSC experience with high school and community college students who may be considering going to UC Santa Cruz. For being such a good school, we found ourselves dissatisfied with the little amount of student experiences online. We want to document fun life that UC Santa Cruz has to offer. We'll also do Mathematics, just so we keep our skills top top.
